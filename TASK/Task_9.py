# Given an array of intervals where intervals [i] = [starti, endil, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
# Example 1:
# Input: intervals = [[1,31, [2,61, [8, 10], [15, 18]]
# Output: [[1,61, [8,101, [15,18]]
# Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6] â€¢
# Example 2:
# Input: intervals = [[1,41, [4,51]
# Output: [[1,511
# Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
